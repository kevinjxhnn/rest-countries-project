## Features

### 1. View All Countries

On the homepage, users can see a list of all countries fetched from the provided API. 

### 2. Search for a Country

Users can search for a specific country using the search input field. The search functionality is implemented to filter countries dynamically as the user types.

### 3. Filter Countries by Region

A region filter allows users to narrow down the displayed countries based on their geographic regions.

### 4. Combined Search and Filter

The search and filter features work together seamlessly. For example, searching for a country within a specific region will display only the relevant result.

### 5. Detailed Country Information

Clicking on a particular country navigates the user to a dedicated page (`/<country_name>`) using React Router. Here, detailed information about the selected country is displayed.

### 6. Dark Theme / Light Theme Toggle

The app provides a theme toggle feature using React Context. Users can switch between dark and light themes based on their preference.
